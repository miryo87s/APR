## OLS Estimator of Treatment Effects

Consider a common scenario in policy evaluation:

For each individual $i$ we observe

-   A binary treatment/policy $D_i$
-   Some outcome variable $Y_i$
-   Control variables/Covariates $X_i$

To estimate the treatment effect, economists often consider **OLS estimator** of $\tau_{ols}$ in
$$
Y_i = \tau_{ols} D_i + X_i \beta + \epsilon_i
$$
and assume **Exogeneity** $\mathbb{E}[\epsilon_i|D_i, X_i] = 0$

## OLS Estimators of Treatment Effects

But what is $\tau_{ols}$?

- $\tau_{ols}$ is ATE in randomized experiments [@imbens2015causal]
- $\tau_{ols}$ is ATE when the treatment effects are homogeneous [@angrist2009mostly]

In the presence of heterogeneous treatment effect

- $\tau_{ols}$ is a convex combination of average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) and untreated (ATU) [@sloczynski2022interpreting]
  - Under **restrictive** assumptions

In this paper, I propose a new interpretation of $\tau_{ols}$ with less assumptions

## The Potential Outcome Framework

The potential outcome framework [@rubin1974estimating] is the most popular tool for treatment effect analysis

Potential outcomes: $Y_i(1)$/$Y_i(0)$ if unit $i$ were treated/untreated

Observed outcome: $Y_i = Y_i(1)D_i + Y_i(0)(1 - D_i)$

There are two assumptions to identify treatment effects

1. **Unconfoundedness** $D_i \perp (Y_i(1), Y_i(0)) | X_i$

*How is this related to Exogeneity?*

2. **Overlap** $0 < P(D_i = 1|X_i) < 1$

*Is this necessary for OLS?*

## Contribution

**Under the potential outcome framework**

- Connect OLS to inverse propensity weighting (IPW)
  - OLS + Linear propensity score = Weighted IPW
  - propose a new causal interpretation of OLS
  - study the properties of OLS from the literature on IPW

<hr>

- Explore the plausibility of Linear propensity score
  - Usually assumed in the literature on causal interpretation of OLS
  - Violation can lead to negative weights in OLS and thus non-causal interpretation
  - Not a concern in one-way fixed effect model and $2 \times 2$ Difference-in-Differences (DiD)
  

## Weighted IPW

Define the ATE 

$\tau_{ate} = \mathbb{E}[Y(1) - Y(0)]$

Under the unconfounded and overlap assumptions, 

The identification strategy of IPW is
$$
\tau_{ipw} = \mathbb{E}\left[\underbrace{\frac{Y_iD_i}{e(X_i)} - \frac{Y_i(1 - D_i)}{1 - e(X_i)}}_{\tau_i := }\right] = \tau_{ate}
$$

Further extended by @hirano2003efficient for ATE in a subpopulation defined by weight $h(X_i)$

$$
\text{Weighted IPW}: \tau_{wipw} = \mathbb{E}\left[\frac{h(X_i)}{\mathbb{E}[h(X_i)]} \cdot \tau_i\right]
$$

All of weighted IPW estimators have a causal interpretation in the sense that
$$
h(X_i) \geqslant 0 \ \forall X_i \quad \text{and} \quad \mathbb{E}\left[\frac{h(X_i)}{\mathbb{E}[h(X_i)]}\right] = 1
$$

## Weighted IPW

Special cases studied in the literature:

![](fig/wipw.png){fig-align="center" width=60%}

Next, I show the equivalence of OLS estimand and overlap IPW

$$
\tau_{overlap} = \mathbb{E}\left[\frac{e(X_i)(1 - e(X_i))}{\mathbb{E}[e(X_i)(1 - e(X_i))]}\cdot \tau_i\right]
$$

## OLS as Propensity Weight

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Proposition

::: {.callout-warning}

## Assumption (Linear Propensity Score)

The propensity score of treatment $D_i$ is a linear function of $X_i$, namely
$$e(x) = P(D_i = 1|X_i) = X_i\beta_e$$

:::

::: {.callout-note #prp-wipw}

(Equivalence of OLS Estimand and Overlap Weighted IPW)

Suppose the linear propensity assumption holds, the OLS estimator of $\tau_{ols}$
$$
\tau_{ols} = \tau_{overlap}
$$

:::

### Proof

By the projection or the Frisch-Waugh-Lovell theorem, we have 
$$
\tau_{ols} = \frac{\mathbb{E}[Y_i\tilde{D}_i]}{\mathbb{E}[\tilde{D}_i^2]}
$$
where $\tilde{D}_i = D_i - X\beta_e$ with $\beta_e = \mathbb{E}[X'X]^{-1}\mathbb{E}[X'D]$. Then we have
$$\begin{aligned}
\tau_{ols} &= \frac{\mathbb{E}[Y_i(D_i - e(X_i))]}{\mathbb{E}[(D_i - e(X_i))^2]} \\
&= \frac{\mathbb{E}[Y_i(D_i - e(X_i))]}{\mathbb{E}[e(X_i)(1 - e(X_i))]} \\
&= \mathbb{E}\left[\frac{e(X_i)(1 - e(X_i))}{\mathbb{E}[e(X_i)(1 - e(X_i))]} \frac{Y_i(D_i - e(X_i))}{e(X_i)(1 - e(X_i))}\right] \\
&= \mathbb{E}\left[\frac{e(X_i)(1 - e(X_i))}{\mathbb{E}[e(X_i)(1 - e(X_i))]} \cdot \tau_i\right] = \tau_{overlap}
\end{aligned}$$

## Comments on @prp-wipw

- OLS is implicitly using a linear specification for the propensity score

- OLS is Weighted IPW, thus has a **causal interpretation**

- The only assumption required is the linear propensity assumption, the **identification of causal effect fully relies on $\tau_i$**
  - Both unconfoundedness and overlap assumption required
  
- In general, OLS does not identify ATE. Extra assumptions required **to identify ATE**:
  - Homogeneous treatment effect (constant $\tau_i$) or
  - Randomized treatment assignment (constant $h(X_i)$)

> As a member of weighted IPW, the overlap weight has been studied by @li2013weighting, we can use their results to learn the properties of OLS estimator of treatment effect

## Properties of OLS estimator

- $Var(\hat\tau_{ols}) \leqslant Var(\hat\tau_{wipw})$ for all $h(\cdot)$^[This explains why OLS estimators have smaller standard errors than IPW estimators, while IPW estimators with a consistent estimator of $e(x)$ is shown to be semiparametrically efficient in @hirano2003efficient]

- Robust to poor overlap: less weights when $e(x)$ is away from $0.5$.

- Weights on $Y_i$: $(1 - e(X_i), e(X_i))$, probability of being assigned to the opposite group.

- $\tau_{ols} \approx$ ATT when $e(x) \approx 0$ as $(1 - e(X_i), e(X_i)) \approx (1, \frac{e(x)}{1 - e(x)})$; $\tau_{ols} \approx$ ATU when $e(x) \approx 1$.^[This suggests to consider ATT as an alternative to ATE or $\tau_{overlap}$ when the treated group is small. Later used in Application]

<hr>

## WLS estimators of ATE

- OLS does not identify ATE in general
- If a researcher is interested in ATE instead of $\tau_{overlap}$
- She can use IPW or the following two regressions

::: {.callout-note #prp-wls}

(Weighted Least Squares Estimators of the ATE)

ATE can be consistently estimated by the following two methods.

1. Regress $Y_i$ on $D_i - \hat{e}(X_i)$ with weight $\left(\frac{1}{\hat{e}(X_i)}, \frac{1}{1 - \hat{e}(X_i)}\right)$

2. Regress $Y_i$ on $1$ and $D$ with weight $\left(\frac{D_i}{\hat{e}(X_i)}, \frac{1 - D_i}{1 - \hat{e}(X_i)}\right)$

where $\hat{e}(x)$ is a consistent estimator of $e(x)$. 
:::


## Violation of Linear Propensity Assumption

Under misspecification of the propensity score, 
$$
\tau_{ols} = \mathbb{E}\left[\frac{D_i - l(X_i)}{D_i - e(X_i)} \cdot \frac{e(X_i)(1 - e(X_i))}{\mathbb{E}[(D_i - l(X_i))^2]} \cdot \tau_i\right]
$$
where $l(Xi)$ is the best linear projection of the propensity score on the covariates.

Combine the linear propensity and overlap assumption
$$
P(0 < X_i\beta < 1)
$$

If linear propensity fails to hold, 
$$
\text{fitted propensity outside} \ [0, 1] \rightarrow \text{negative weights in} \ \tau_{ols}
$$

Weights are negative if $l(X_i) > 1$ and $D_i = 1$, or if $l(X_i) < 0$ and $D_i = 0$

## Violation of Linear Propensity Assumption

- The problem of negative weights can be serious
- Often ignored by researchers because the linear regression of $e(x)$ is done in the background
  - In @lalonde1986evaluating, $45\%$ of the fitted propensity score is negative
  - In @aizer2016long, $31\%$ of the fitted propensities in the baseline model is outside $[0, 1]$
    - Effect of cash transfer to poor family on the longevity of children
    - Cash transfer increases about 1 year of lift expectancy relative to a mean of 72.5

## Simulation

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Design

Four scenarios $\gamma = 1, 2, 3, 4$ with increasing tail of $e(x)$

$X = (X_1, .. X_6)$ 1-3 continuous and 4-6 binary

Logit Propensity score with nonlinear treatment effect
$$
e(X) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(- \alpha_0 - X\alpha)}
$$
$α = (0.15γ, 0.3γ, 0.3γ, −0.2γ, −0.25γ, −0.25γ)$ 

Choose $\alpha_0$ so that the proportion of treated units is approximately 0.4 for each $\gamma$
$$
Y = \beta_0 + X\beta + D\tau(X) + \epsilon
$$

$$\tau(X) = X_1^2 + X_4 - X_6$$

Adequate overlap so that the bias mostly come form negative weights

## When Linear Propensity is Not a Concern

The propensity score is [inherently linear if the propensity score is saturated]{.blue}

::: {.callout-note #prp-owfe}

(One-way fixed effect model)

$$
Y_i = \alpha_s + \tau_{owfe} D_i + \epsilon_i
$$
where $\alpha_s$ is the strata fixed effects. 

Let $N_{1s} = \sum_{i \in s}D_i$, $N_{0s} = \sum_{i \in s}1 - D_i$ 

and $\bar{Y}_{ds}$ be the sample mean of $Y_i$ in the treatment and control group for $d = 1, 0$
$$
\tau_{owfe} = \mathbb{E}\left[\frac{h(s)}{\mathbb{E}[h(s)]}\cdot \tau_s\right]
$$
where $e(s) = \frac{N_{1s}}{N_{1s} + N_{0s}}$, $h(s) = e(s)(1 - e(s))= \frac{N_{1s}N_{0s}}{N_{1s} + N_{0s}}$, $\tau_s = \bar{Y}_{1s} - \bar{Y}_{0s}$.
:::

The $h(s)$ is exactly the precision weight that minimizes the variance of treatment effect in stratified experiments [@imbens2015causal chap. 9.4]

## When Linear Propensity is Not a Concern

The negative weights can be used as [a part of identification procedure]{.blue} such as in DiD

- @prp-owfe does not generalize to two-way fixed effect models (TWFE).
- Because the two-way fixed effects overlap with each other and thus not mutually exclusive
- DiD assumptions make use of the negative weights and move the goalpost from $\tau_overlap$ to ATT

Consider the general case of multi-period and multi-group DiD. For each unit $i$: 

- Initial treatment period $C_i \in \{1, ..., T, \infty\}$ 
- Realized outcome $Y_{it} = Y_{it}(C_i)$ with $C_i = \infty$ represents the units who are never treated. 
- $D_{it} = 1_{C_i \leqslant t}$ 
- A unit belongs to cohort $c$ if $C_i = c$

## When Linear Propensity is Not a Concern

TWFE estimation of DiD: 
$$
Y_{it} = \alpha_i + \gamma_t + \tau_{twfe} D_{it} + \epsilon_{it}
$$

Define $\bar{Y}_t^c = \frac{1}{N_c}\sum_{i:C_i = c} Y_{it}$ and $\hat\tau_t^{cc'} = \bar{Y}_t^{c'} - \bar{Y}_t^c$

::: {.callout-note #prp-twfe}

Decomposition of TWFE estimator of DiD

$$
\hat\tau_{twfe} = \sum_t \sum_{c \leqslant t} w_t^c \hat\tau_t^{\infty c} + \sum_t \sum_{c > t} w_t^c \hat\tau_{t}^{\infty c}
$$
with properties $\sum_t\sum_{c \leqslant t} w_t^c = 1$ and $\sum_t\sum_{c > t} w_t^c  = -1$.
:::


## When Linear Propensity is Not a Concern

- The first term: weighted comparison of treated cohort vs never-treated cohort at $t$
- The second term: weighted comparison of not-yet-treated vs never-treated cohort at $t$

For $2 \times 2$ DiD, $t \in \{1, 2\}$ and $c \in \{2, \infty\}$

![](fig/twfe.png){fig-align="center" width=40%}

Under the parallel trend and no anticipation assumption, @prp-twfe implies 
$$
\hat\tau_{twfe} = -\hat\tau_1^{\infty2} + \hat\tau_2^{\infty2} = (\bar{Y}_2^2 - \bar{Y}_2^\infty) - (\bar{Y}_1^2 - \bar{Y}_1^\infty) \xrightarrow{p} \mathbb{E}[Y_{it}(1) - Y_{it}(0)|D_{it} = 1]
$$

## Conclusion

[Under the linear propensity assumption]{.blue}

- OLS = overlap IPW
- OLS identifies a weighted ATE, with more weights assigned to the common support
- OLS has the nice properties of overlap weights

[If linear propensity assumption is violated]{.blue}

- OLS has negative weights due to fitted values of propensity score outside $[0, 1]$
- OLS is non-causal

[Linear propensity score is not a consern for]{.blue}

- One-way fixed effect model
- $2 \times 2$ DiD
