## OLS Estimator of Treatment Effects

<br>

Consider a common scenario in policy evaluation:

For each individual $i$ we observe

-   A binary treatment/policy $D_i$
-   Some outcome variable $Y_i$
-   Control variables/Covariates $X_i$

To estimate the treatment effect, economists often consider **OLS estimator** of $\tau_{ols}$ in
$$
Y_i = \tau_{ols} D_i + X_i \beta + \epsilon_i, \quad \quad \mathbb{E}[\epsilon_i|D_i, X_i] = 0
$$

[But what is the causal interpretation of $\tau_{ols}$?]{.blue}

## Preview of Results

<br>

- **A general causal interpretation of $\tau_{ols}$ under heterogeneous treatment effect**
  - Under standard assumptions
  - Build connection between OLS and Inverse Propensity Weighting (IPW)
  - OLS + **linear propensity score** = Weighted IPW
  - OLS identifies **overlap-weighted ATE**
- **OLS is inferior to IPW**
- **OLS identification relies on correct specification of $\mathbb{E}[D_i|X_i]$**

- Investigate several estimators of OLS and IPW
- Illustrate results with an application to the NSW-CPS data [@lalonde1986evaluating]
  

## Literature Review

[Interpretation of $\tau_{ols}$ in special cases]{.blue}

- @imbens2015causal: In randomized experiments, $\tau_{ols}$ is ATE
- @angrist2009mostly: Under homogeneous treatment effect, $\tau_{ols}$ is ATE

[Under heterogeneous treatment effect]{.blue}

- @angrist1998estimating: $\tau_{ols}$ is a convex combination of ATEs in strata defined by **discrete $X_i$**

- Similar causal interpretation is given by @aronow2016does
  - $\tau_{ols}$ is a weighted average of individual treatment effects
$$
\tau_{ols} = \frac{\mathbb{E}[w_i\tau_i]}{\mathbb{E}[w_i]}
$$
where $\tau_i = Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)$ is the individual treatment effect.
  - **No connection to IPW or properties of $w_i$**
  - **Incorrect generalization to categorical and continuous $D_i$**

## Literature Review

[Under heterogeneous treatment effect]{.blue}

- @sloczynski2022interpreting:
$$
\tau_{ols} = w \times \tau_{APLE, 1} + (1 - w) \times \tau_{APLE, 0}
$$

  - $\tau_{APLE, d}$ is the projection of potential outcome $Y_i(d)$ on $\mathbb{E}[D_i|X_i]$
  - $\tau_{APLE, d}$ is causal if **$Y_i(d)$ is a linear function of $\mathbb{E}[D_i|X_i]$** (restrictive assumption)
  - $w$ is **decreasing in the size of the treated group**
  - I use standard assumptions and the weights have similar properties

<br>

- @kline2011oaxaca: Oaxaca-Blinder (or full-interaction regression) is equivalent to IPW 
  - Assumes that conditional treatment odds is linear in $X_i$
  - Also shows OB is doubly robust
  - Unclear when without interactions

## Literature Review

[OLS with multiple treatment]{.blue}

- @goldsmith2022contamination
$$
Y_i = \tau_1D_{1i} + \tau_2D_{2i} + X_i\beta + \epsilon_i
$$
  - OLS estimators $\hat\tau_1$ and $\hat\tau_2$ are biased even in randomized experiments
  - I focus on the case with one binary treatment

<br>

[IPW and weighted IPW]{.blue}

- @rosenbaum1983central; @robins1995semiparametric; @hahn1998role and many others
- A class of weighted IPW was first proposed by @hirano2003efficient
- @li2018balancing proposed **overlap-weighted IPW**
  - I show **OLS is overlap-weighted IPW with linear propensity**
  
## Outline

<br>

1. The class of weighted IPW

<br>

2. Connection between OLS and weighted IPW

<br>

3. Properties of OLS as a causal method

<br>

4. Various estimators of weighted effects

<br>

5. Application

## The Potential Outcome Framework

<br>

**The potential outcome framework** [@rubin1974estimating]

- Potential outcomes: $Y_i(1)$/$Y_i(0)$ if unit $i$ were treated/untreated
- Binary treatment $D_i$
- Observed outcome: $Y_i = Y_i(1)D_i + Y_i(0)(1 - D_i)$
- We observe data $(Y_i, D_i, X_i)$

<br>

Two standard assumptions to identify treatment effect

1. **Unconfoundedness** $D_i \perp (Y_i(1), Y_i(0)) | X_i$

2. **Overlap** $0 < P(D_i = 1|X_i) < 1$

## IPW Identification of Treatment Effects

Define the ATE: $\tau_{ate} = \mathbb{E}[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)]$

Under the unconfounded and overlap assumptions, 

Let $e(X_i) = P(D_i = 1|X_i)$ be the propensity score. The identification strategy of IPW is
$$
\tau_{ipw} = \mathbb{E}\left[\underbrace{\frac{Y_iD_i}{e(X_i)} - \frac{Y_i(1 - D_i)}{1 - e(X_i)}}_{\delta_i := }\right] = \tau_{ate}
$$

Further extended by @hirano2003efficient for ATE in a subpopulation defined by weight $h(X_i)$

$$
\text{Weighted IPW}: \tau_{wipw} = \mathbb{E}\left[\frac{h(X_i)}{\mathbb{E}[h(X_i)]} \cdot \delta_i\right]
$$

All of weighted IPW estimators have a causal interpretation in the sense that
$$
h(X_i) > 0 \ \forall X_i \quad \text{and} \quad \mathbb{E}\left[\frac{h(X_i)}{\mathbb{E}[h(X_i)]}\right] = 1
$$

## Weighted IPW {#wipw}

Special cases studied in the literature:

![](fig/wipw.png){fig-align="center" width=60%}

Next, I show the equivalence of OLS estimand and overlap IPW

$$
\tau_{overlap} = \mathbb{E}\left[\frac{e(X_i)(1 - e(X_i))}{\mathbb{E}[e(X_i)(1 - e(X_i))]}\cdot \delta_i\right]
$$

[Group Weights](#gweight)

## OLS as Propensity Weight

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Proposition

::: {.callout-warning}

## Assumption (Linear Propensity Score)

The propensity score of treatment $D_i$ is a linear function of $X_i$, namely
$$e(X_i) = P(D_i = 1|X_i) = X_i\beta_e$$

:::

::: {.callout-note #prp-wipw}

## Proposition 1 (Equivalence of OLS Estimand and Overlap Weighted IPW)

Suppose the linear propensity assumption holds, the OLS estimator of $\tau_{ols}$
$$
\tau_{ols} = \tau_{overlap}
$$

:::

### Proof

By the projection or the Frisch-Waugh-Lovell theorem, we have 
$$
\tau_{ols} = \frac{\mathbb{E}[Y_i\tilde{D}_i]}{\mathbb{E}[\tilde{D}_i^2]}
$$
where $\tilde{D}_i = D_i - X_i\beta_e$ with $\beta_e = \mathbb{E}[X'X]^{-1}\mathbb{E}[X'D]$. Then we have
$$\begin{aligned}
\tau_{ols} &= \frac{\mathbb{E}[Y_i(D_i - e(X_i))]}{\mathbb{E}[(D_i - e(X_i))^2]} \\
&= \frac{\mathbb{E}[Y_i(D_i - e(X_i))]}{\mathbb{E}[e(X_i)(1 - e(X_i))]} \\
&= \mathbb{E}\left[\frac{e(X_i)(1 - e(X_i))}{\mathbb{E}[e(X_i)(1 - e(X_i))]} \frac{Y_i(D_i - e(X_i))}{e(X_i)(1 - e(X_i))}\right] \\
&= \mathbb{E}\left[\frac{e(X_i)(1 - e(X_i))}{\mathbb{E}[e(X_i)(1 - e(X_i))]} \cdot \delta_i\right] = \tau_{overlap}
\end{aligned}$$

## Comments on @prp-wipw

<br>

- Linear propensity score assumptions has been assumed in @aronow2016does; @abadie2020sampling; @sloczynski2022interpreting
  - Also common in empirical studies
  - Not necessarily strong because $X_i$ can include powers and interactions
  - **Inherently satisfied** with saturated model
- OLS is Weighted IPW, thus has a **causal interpretation**
- In general, OLS does not identify ATE, unless one of the following holds:
  - Homogeneous treatment effect (constant $\tau_i$) or
  - Randomized treatment assignment (constant $h(X_i)$)

## Example: One-way Fixed Effect Model {#example1}

<br>

OWFE is one example of saturated model
$$
Y_i = \alpha_s + \tau_{owfe}D_i + \epsilon_i
$$
where $\alpha_s$ is strata fixed effect.

Let $n_{1s} = \sum_{i \in s}D_i$, $n_{0s} = \sum_{i \in s}1 - D_i$

Let $\bar{Y}_{1s}$, $\bar{Y}_{0s}$ be the sample mean of $Y_i$ in the treatment and control group in strata $s$

$$
\tau_{owfe} = \mathbb{E}\left[\frac{h(s)}{\mathbb{E}[h(x)]} \cdot \tau_s \right]
$$
where $e(s) = \frac{n_{1s}}{n_{1s} + n_{0s}}$, $h(s) = e(s)(1 - e(s)) = \frac{n_{1s}n_{0s}}{n_{1s} + n_{0s}}$, $\tau_s = \bar{Y}_{1s} - \bar{Y}_{0s}$

<br>

[Example 2: TWFE for $2 \times 2$ DiD](#example2)

## Properties of OLS (overlap weight)

<br>

- The purpose of weighting is to achieve similar distribution of $X_i$ in the treated and control group
- Let $f_d(x) = P(X_i = x|D_i = d)$ be the density of $X_i$ in the treated and control group

## Properties of OLS (overlap weight) {#gweight}

<br>

[From $h(x)$ to weights on each group]{.blue}

- By Bayes rule

$$
f_1(x) = \frac{e(x)f(x)}{P(D_i = 1)}, \quad \quad f_0(x) = \frac{(1 - e(x))f(x)}{P(D_i = 0)}
$$

- Let $f_1(x)g_1(x) = f_0(x)g_0(x) = f(x)h(x)$, again by Bayes rule 

$$
g_1(x) \propto h(x)/e(x), \quad \quad g_0(x) \propto h(x)/(1 - e(x))
$$

- For overlap weights, $(g_1(x), g_0(x)) = (1 - e(x), e(x))$

[WIPW Table](#wipw)

## Properties of OLS (overlap weight)

<br>

[Properties:]{.blue}

1. **Undesired weights**: Treated and control groups are weighted by probability of being assigned to the opposite group.
    - @sloczynski2022interpreting weights have similar property
    - Another way to see this is by rearranging $\tau_{ols}$
$$
\tau_{ols} = \frac{\mathbb{E}[\color{red}(1 - e(X_i))\color{black}D_iY_i - \color{red}e(X_i)\color{black}(1 - D_i)Y_i]}{\mathbb{E}[e(X_i)(1 - e(X_i))]}
$$

2. $\tau_{ols} \approx$ ATT when $e(x) \approx 0$ as $(1 - e(X_i), e(X_i)) \approx (1, \frac{e(x)}{1 - e(x)})$; $\tau_{ols} \approx$ ATU when $e(x) \approx 1$.

## Properties of OLS (overlap weight)

<br>

[Properties [@li2018balancing]:]{.blue}

3. **Efficiency**: $Var(\hat\tau_{ols}) \leqslant Var(\hat\tau_{wipw})$ for all $h(X_i)$
4. **Robust to poor overlap**: 
    - Bounded
    - Maximized with $e(x) = 0.5$
    - More weights when $e(x)$ is close to $0.5$, less weights when $e(x)$ away from $0.5$.
5. **Exact sample balance** with logit $e(x)$

$$
\frac{\sum_i X_i D_i (1 - \hat{e}(X_i))}{\sum_i D_i (1 - \hat{e}(X_i))} = \frac{\sum_i X_i (1 - D_i) \hat{e}(X_i)}{\sum_i (1 - D_i) \hat{e}(X_i)}
$$

## Is OLS Without Interactions Doubly Robust?

<br>

- Double robustness means that $\hat\tau$ is consistent of ATE if either $\mathbb{E}[D_i|X_i]$ or $\mathbb{E}[Y_i(d)|X_i]$ is correctly specified
- Is $\tau_{ols}$ a doubly robust estimand of overlap ATE?

[Why do we care?]{.blue}

1. Modelling choices
    - How to choose $X_i$ when we write down the regression equation

2. Robustness of OLS
    - @kline2011oaxaca shows that OB (full interaction regression) targets ATE and is doubly robust
$$
Y_i = \tau_{ob} D_i + X_i \beta + D_i(X_i - \bar{X})\gamma + \epsilon_i
$$
    - IPW has a doubly robust version: Augmented IPW (AIPW)[@robins1994estimation]

## Is OLS Without Interactions Doubly Robust?

<br>

$$
\tau_{ols} = \mathbb{E}\left[h(X_i)(\mu_{1, ols}(X_i) - \mu_{0, ols}(X_i))\right]
$$
where
$$\begin{aligned}
&\mu_{1, ols}(X_i) = Y_i(1) + \frac{(D_i - e(X_i)Y_i(1)) - (D_i - e(X_i))e(X_i)(Y_i(1) + \mu_1(X_i))}{e(X_i)(1 - e(X_i))} \\
&\mu_{0, ols}(X_i) = Y_i(0) + \frac{(D_i - e(X_i)\mu_0(X_i)) - (D_i - e(X_i))e(X_i)(Y_i(0) + \mu_0(X_i))}{e(X_i)(1 - e(X_i))} \\
&\mu_d(X_i) = \mathbb{E}[Y_i(d)|X_i]
\end{aligned}$$
Therefore,
$$\begin{aligned}
\tau_{ols} = \tau_{overlap} &+ \mathbb{E}\left[h(X_i) \cdot \frac{(D_i - e(X_i))(Y_i(1) - \mu_0(X_i))}{e(X_i)(1 - e(X_i))}\right] \\
&- \mathbb{E}\left[h(X_i) \cdot \frac{(D_i - e(X_i))e(X_i)(Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) + \mu_1(X_i) - \mu_0(X_i))}{e(X_i)(1 - e(X_i))}\right]
\end{aligned}$$

## Comments on Robustness of OLS {#robust}

<br>

- If $e(X_i)$ is correctly specified but $\mu_d(X_i)$ is not, $\tau_{ols} = \tau_{overlap}$
- If $\mu_d(X_i)$ is correctly specified but $e(X_i)$ is not, $\tau_{ols} \neq \tau_{overlap}$

<br>

- Counter-intuitive modelling procedure
  - When writing down the model $Y_i = \tau_{ols} D_i + X_i \beta + \epsilon_i$
  - **choose $X_i$ in the propensity model instead of variables that affects $Y_i$**
- Identification completely relies on specification of $\mathbb{E}[D_i|X_i]$
- Be careful with linear propensity assumption
  - [Simulations results](#sim) on bias of OLS when propensity is nonlinear

## Estimating Weighted ATE: IPW

- Two commonly used IPW estimators can be adapted to estimate weighted ATE
  - Horvitz-Thompson (HT) type estimator [@hirano2003efficient]
$$
\hat\tau^h_{HT} = \sum_{i = 1}^{N} \hat{h}(X_i) \left(\frac{Y_i D_i}{\hat{e}(X_i)} - \frac{Y_i(1 - D_i)}{1 - \hat{e}(X_i)}\right) \bigg/ \sum_{i = 1}^{N} \hat{h}(X_i)
$$
  - Hajek type estimator [@li2018balancing]
$$
\hat\tau^h_{Hajek} = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^N Y_i D_i \hat{w}_1(X_i)}{\sum_{i = 1}^N D_i \hat{w}_1(X_i)} - \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^N Y_i (1 - D_i) \hat{w}_0(X_i)}{\sum_{i = 1}^N (1 - D_i) \hat{w}_0(X_i)}
$$
where $\hat{w}_1(x) = \hat{h}(x) / \hat{e}(x)$ and $\hat{w}_0(x) = \hat{h}(x) / (1 - \hat{e}(x))$. Both estimators are consistent for $\tau_{wipw}$ and they are asymptotically equivalent. 

- @prp-wipw shows that the two estimators are both consistent and asymptotically equivalent
- In finite sample, they are usually numerically different

## Estimating Weighted ATE: IPW

::: {.callout-note #prp-wipw}

## Proposition 2 (Influence Function of $\hat\tau^h_{HT}$ and $\hat\tau^h_{Hajek}$)

Suppose the unconfoundedness and overlap assumptions hold, $\hat\tau^h_{HT}$ and $\hat\tau^h_{Hajek}$ shares the same influence function. Namely, 
$$\begin{aligned}
&\sqrt{n}(\hat\tau^h_{HT} - \tau_{wipw}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\sum_{i = 1}^n \psi(Y_i, D_i, X_i) + o_p(1) \\
&\sqrt{n}(\hat\tau^h_{Hajek} - \tau_{wipw}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\sum_{i = 1}^n \psi(Y_i, D_i, X_i) + o_p(1)
\end{aligned}$$
with
$$\begin{aligned}
\psi(y, d, x) = \frac{dh(x)}{\bar{h}e(x)}(y - \mu_1(x)) - \frac{(1 - d)h(x)}{\bar{h}(1 - e(x))}(y - \mu_0(x)) + \frac{h(x)}{\bar{h}} + \frac{(d - e(x))\partial_eh(x)}{\bar{h}}(\tau_{wipw} - \tau_{wate})
\end{aligned}$$
where $\mu_d(x) = \mathbb{E}[Y_i(d)|X_i = x]$ for $d = 0, 1$, $\bar{h} = \mathbb{E}[h(X_i)]$ and $\partial_e h(x)$ is the Gateaux derivative of $h(x)$ with respect to $e(x)$.

:::

## Estimating ATE: OLS

<br>

- OLS does not identify ATE in general
- LS estimation of the class of weighted ATE is difficult
- If a researcher is interested in ATE instead of $\tau_{overlap}$
- She can use IPW or the following two regressions, both are consistent

**Weighted Least Squares Estimators of the ATE**

1. Regress $Y_i$ on $D_i - \hat{e}(X_i)$ with weight $\left(\frac{1}{\hat{e}(X_i)} + \frac{1}{1 - \hat{e}(X_i)}\right)$

2. Regress $Y_i$ on $1$ and $D_i$ with weight $\left(\frac{D_i}{\hat{e}(X_i)} + \frac{1 - D_i}{1 - \hat{e}(X_i)}\right)$

where $\hat{e}(x)$ is a consistent estimator of $e(x)$. 

## Application

<br>

**NSW-CPS data constructed by @lalonde1986evaluating**

- NSW: US job training experiment; CPS: Survey data in the US
- $Y_i$: earnings in 1976
- $D_i$: participation in NSW job training program
- $X_i$: demographics, earnings in previous year
- Target is the treatment effect on earnings

<br>

- Experimental benchmark: ATT = $\$1794$

<br>

- I follow the specifications in @sloczynski2022interpreting
- Compare $\tau_{overlap}$ OLS/IPW estimators with linear/logit $e(x)$

## Conclusion

<br>

- When using OLS, change the interpretation of the coefficient
  - ATE $\rightarrow$ overlap-weighted ATE
  - OLS is not doubly robust and identification depends on specification of the propensity model

<br>

- OLS is inferior to IPW
  - OLS = overlap IPW + linear propensity assumption
  - IPW has more flexibility in terms of specifying the propensity model
  - IPW can easily identify different WATEs
  - AIPW provides more robustness

### Design

Four scenarios $\gamma = 1, 2, 3, 4$ with increasing tail of $e(x)$

$X = (X_1, .. X_6)$ 1-3 continuous and 4-6 binary

Logit Propensity score with nonlinear treatment effect

$$
$α = (0.15γ, 0.3γ, 0.3γ, −0.2γ, −0.25γ, −0.25γ)$ 

Choose $\alpha_0$ so that the proportion of treated units is approximately 0.4 for each $\gamma$
